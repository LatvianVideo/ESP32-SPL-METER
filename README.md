# Standalone ESP32 Bass SPL Meter
This is my attempt at making an affordable bass SPL meter.

## Why did you make this?
I cannot afford proper spl meters such as the spl-labs mini bass meter and wanted a cheaper solution.

## Can this compete with the spl-labs or others?
No, this meter is missing many major parts, the main one being calibrated accuracy and reliability.
